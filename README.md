## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular services with clear separation of concerns.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Powered by RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.
- **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**: Integrated Polly for retries, circuit breakers, and fallback.
- **Containerization**: All services are dockerized for consistency and ease of deployment.
- **Scalable Design**: Services can be independently scaled and deployed.
- **Real-World Use Case**: Covers core aspects of an actual eCommerce system (Catalog, Basket, Order, Payment, etc.).

- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **Polly (.NET resilience library)**
